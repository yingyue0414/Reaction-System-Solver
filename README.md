# Reaction IVP Solver
This solver provides a set of functions for working with chemical reaction systems, including parsing reaction strings, solving reaction kinetics, and modifying reaction rates. It is written in Python 3.9.7 and utilizes libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, and SciPy.

## WARNING
The following content of this `README.md` suggests the end goal of this module, not the current progress. Currently, the module is not wrapped to a
package, but is already able to intepret reaction strings and solve IVP using scipy.

## 1. Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

The Reaction Kinetics solver is a collection of functions that simplify the handling and analysis of chemical reaction systems. It includes functionalities for parsing reaction strings, generating reactant and product matrices, solving reaction kinetics, and modifying reaction rates.

## 2. Installation <a name="installation"></a>

No installation is required for this solver. Simply include the provided Python script in your project and import the necessary functions as needed.

```python
from reaction_kinetics_solver import parse_reaction_string, parse_stoichiometry_string, \
    extract_species_dictionaries_from_reaction_strings, parse_reaction_strings, \
    calculate_macroscopic_reaction_rates, dydt, dydt_scalar_decorator
```

## 3. Usage <a name="usage"></a>

### 3.1. Parsing Reaction Strings <a name="parsing-reaction-strings"></a>

Use the provided functions to parse reaction strings into their constituent parts - reactants, products, and rate constants.

```python
# Example usage:
input_string = "A + 2B -> C, k1"
reactants, products, rate_constant = parse_reaction_string(input_string)
print("Reactants:", reactants)  # Output: A + 2B
print("Products:", products)    # Output: C
print("Rate Constant:", rate_constant)  # Output: k1
```

### 3.2. Reaction Matrices <a name="reaction-matrices"></a>

Define the reactant and product matrices for a set of reactions and solve the kinetics using the provided functions.

```python
# Sample usage:
t_span = [0, 20]
y_initial = [3, 10, 7]
k = [1, 1, 1, 1]
species_names, reactant_matrix, product_matrix, rate_constant_names = \
    parse_reaction_strings(reaction_strings)

# Solve the kinetics using scipy.integrate.solve_ivp
sol = solve_ivp(dydt, t_span, y_initial, args=(reactant_matrix, product_matrix, k), dense_output=True)
```

### 3.3. Solving Reaction Kinetics <a name="solving-reaction-kinetics"></a>

Utilize the `solve_ivp` function from SciPy to solve the kinetics of a chemical reaction system. Plot the results using Matplotlib.

```python
t = np.linspace(0, 20, 300)
y = sol.sol(t)
plt.plot(t, y.T)
plt.xlabel('Time')
plt.ylabel('Concentration')
plt.legend(np.arange(len(y_initial))
plt.show()
```

### 3.4. Modifying Reaction Rates <a name="modifying-reaction-rates"></a>

Apply a scalar factor to reaction rates using the `dydt_scalar_decorator` function. This allows for the modulation of reaction rates, which can be useful for sensitivity analyses or parameter variations.

```python
scalar = np.array([1.5, 1, 4, 1])  # Scalar values for each rate constant
dydtmodified = dydt_scalar_decorator(dydt)

# Solve the kinetics with modified rates
solmodified = solve_ivp(dydtmodified, t_span, y_initial,
                        args=(reactant_matrix, product_matrix, k, scalar), dense_output=True)
```
