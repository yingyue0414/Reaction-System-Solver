# Reaction System Solver
This solver provides a set of functions for working with chemical reaction systems, including parsing reaction strings, solving reaction kinetics, and modifying reaction rates. It is written in Python 3.9.7 and utilizes libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, and SciPy.

Note that the module main serves as a tool to generate the `dydt` function from strings of reactions. The module / method to solve IVP for these `dydt` can be customly defined after such function is generated.

## WARNING
The following content of this `README.md` suggests the end goal of this module, not the current progress. Currently, the module is not wrapped to a
package, but is already able to intepret reaction strings and solve IVP using scipy.

Please refer to the docstrings for each method for detailed explanations and examples.

### 3.2. Reaction Matrices <a name="reaction-matrices"></a>

Define the reactant and product matrices for a set of reactions.

```python
# Sample usage:
t_span = [0, 20]
y_initial = [3, 10, 7]
k = [1, 1, 1, 1]
species_names, reactant_matrix, product_matrix, rate_constant_names = \
    parse_reaction_strings(reaction_strings)
```

### 3.3. Solving Reaction Kinetics <a name="solving-reaction-kinetics"></a>

In the module, I utilize the `solve_ivp` function from SciPy to solve the kinetics of a chemical reaction system. Plot the results using Matplotlib.
However this is just to showcase the feasbility of solving ODE through constructing matrices. i.e. after constructing the dydt function,
you can use any method of solving the system of ODEs.

```python
# Solve the kinetics using scipy.integrate.solve_ivp
sol = solve_ivp(dydt, t_span, y_initial, args=(reactant_matrix, product_matrix, k), dense_output=True)
```

### 3.4. Modifying the Model wtih Decorators <a name="decorators"></a>

An example usage of a decorator is as follows: assuming we would like to apply a scalar factor (ex. set some concentration to be const) to reaction rates using the `dydt_scalar_decorator` function. This allows for the modulation of reaction rates, which can be useful for sensitivity analyses or parameter variations.

```python
scalar = np.array([1.5, 1, 4, 1])  # Scalar values for each rate constant
dydtmodified = dydt_scalar_decorator(dydt)

# Solve the kinetics with modified rates
solmodified = solve_ivp(dydtmodified, t_span, y_initial,
                        args=(reactant_matrix, product_matrix, k, scalar), dense_output=True)
```
